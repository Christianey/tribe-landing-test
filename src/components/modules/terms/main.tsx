        LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY
      </h3>
      <p className="lg:text-lg text-base font-normal mb-3 text-text-gray-text">
        By downloading or using the platform, these terms will automatically
        apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
        carefully before using the platform. You’re not allowed to copy, or
        modify the platform, any part of the platform in any way. You’re not
        allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the platform, and you
        also shouldn’t try to translate the platform into other languages, or
        make derivative versions. The platform itself, and all the database
        rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still
        belong to Tribapay. We are committed to ensuring that the platform is as
        useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
        to make changes to the platform or to charge for its services, at any
        time and for any reason of which will be clearly communicated. We will
        never charge you for the platform or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for through subscription
        options. The Tribapay platform stores and processes personal data that
        you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your
        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the platform secure. We
        therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which
        is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed
        by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your
        phone’s security features and it could mean that the Tribapay platform
        won’t work properly or at all.

      <h3 className="mt-4 mb-3 lg:text-lg text-base font-bold text-primary-main">
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
      </h3>
      <p className="lg:text-lg text-base font-normal mb-3 text-text-gray-text">
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Tribapay will not
        take responsibility for. Certain functions of the platform will require
        the platform to have an active internet connection. The connection can
        be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Tribapay
        cannot take responsibility for the platform not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
        of your data allowance left. If you’re using the platform outside of an
        area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement
        with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
        be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration
        of the connection while accessing the platform, or other third party
        charges. In using the platform, you’re accepting responsibility for any
        such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the platform
        outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
        off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
        you’re using the platform, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the platform. Along
        the same lines, Tribapay cannot always take responsibility for the way
        you use the platform i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays
        charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
        the Service, Tribapay cannot accept responsibility. With respect to
        Tribapay’s responsibility for your use of the platform, when you’re
        using the platform, it’s important to bear in mind that although we
        endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
        it available to you. Tribapay accepts no liability for any loss, direct
        or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
        functionality of the platform. At some point, we may wish to update the
        platform.

        CLASS ACTION WAIVER
      </h3>
      <p className="lg:text-lg text-base font-normal mb-3 text-text-gray-text">
        To the extent permissible by law, all claims will only be brought on an
        individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
        purported class, collective action, or representative capacity
        (collectively referred to as Class Action Waiver). The arbitrator may
        not consolidate mote than one person’s claims or engage in any class
        arbitration. You acknowledge that, by agreeing to these terms, you and
        Tribapay are each waiving any right to a trial by Jury, and you are
        waiving the right to participate in a class action against Tribapay.

        ARBITRATION
      </h3>

        You and Tribapay agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to
        this Agreement or the Services, shall be finally settled in binding
        arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with the Nigerian
        Arbitration Commision’s rules for arbitration of consumer-related
        disputes (accessible at nicarb.org ). Subject to applicable
        jurisdictional requirements, consumer claimants (individuals whose
        transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may
        elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather
        than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims
        court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or
        non-representative) basis{" "}
